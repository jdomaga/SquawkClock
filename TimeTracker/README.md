Timer app, that lets you say what your doing, start timer, and stop it
Collects data for a week (local storage to save), and at the end it gives you a summary / charts
Both how much you did for each task
How much those tasks were in addition to every day stuff
How the time for each task stacks up to each other
Can trend over weeks too

instead of having like a timer, probs just want to add "start" and "end" timestamps
